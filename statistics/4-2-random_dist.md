[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Another visualization to compare distributions are by using *CDF (cumulative distribution function)*, which shows value vs. its cumulative probability (instead of independent probability in PMF) as the value increases. This is especially useful when we have huge number of values.

*The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*
```python
'''Please run code inside thinkstats2/code folder'''
import numpy as np
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

randomval = np.random.random(1000)
pmf_randomval = thinkstats2.Pmf(randomval)
cdf_randomval = thinkstats2.Cdf(randomval)

thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_randomval)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random value', ylabel='PMF')
```
